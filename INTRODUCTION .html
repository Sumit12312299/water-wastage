            Wastewater (or waste water) is water generated after the use of freshwater, raw water, drinking water or saline water in a variety of deliberate applications or processes.Another definition of wastewater is "Used water from any combination of domestic, industrial, commercial or agricultural activities, surface runoff / storm water, and any sewer inflow or sewer infiltration".In everyday usage, wastewater is commonly a synonym for sewage (also called domestic wastewater or municipal wastewater), which is wastewater that is produced by a community of people.

          </p>
          <p>
            1.<b>Industrial wastewater:</b> waterborne waste generated from a variety of industrial processes, such as manufacturing operations, mineral extraction, power generation, or water and wastewater treatment.
          </p>
          <p>
          2.<b>Cooling water</b>, released with potential thermal pollution after use to condense steam or reduce machinery temperatures by conduction or evaporation.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.<b>Leachate:</b>precipitation containing pollutants dissolved while percolating through ores, raw materials, products, or solid waste. 
          </p>
          <p>
            4.<b>Return flow: </b>the flow of water carrying suspended soil, pesticide residues, or dissolved minerals and nutrients from irrigated cropland.
          </p>
          <p>
            5.<b>Surface runoff:</b>the flow of water occurring on the ground surface when excess rainwater, stormwater, meltwater, or other sources, can no longer sufficiently rapidly infiltrate in the soil.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.<b>Urban runoff</b>, including water used for outdoor cleaning activity and landscape irrigation in densely populated areas created by urbanization.
