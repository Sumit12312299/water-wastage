        Types Of Waste Water
    </h1><hr>
    <p>
        We can generally divide wastewater into three types: Blackwater,
Yellow water, and Greywater.
    </p>
    <h1>
        Blackwater<hr>
    </h1>
    <p>
        Blackwater is wastewater which originates from places such as
dishwashers, food preparation sinks, and toilet fixtures. It consists of
various chemicals and substances that can go down bath drains, sink
drains, and toilets which includes urine, poop, toilet paper, and wipes.
Blackwater is also considered to be highly pathogenic as well, since the
organic matter in this water is home to millions, if not billions, of Bacteria. An image of Blackwater draining into the sea is show in
background of the heading!

        Yellow water
    </h1><hr>

    <p>
        Yellow water, as the name suggests is yellow. This is because it contains
a high amount of urine in it. There is no other contamination of
substances other than urine in Yellow water, unlike other types of
wastewater.
    </p>
    <hr><h1>
        Greywater
    </h1><hr>
    <p>
        Greywater originates from areas such as non-toilet and food fixtures,
laundry machines, spas, bathtubs, and more. If you want to make things
simpler, it is a type of wastewater that is devoid of urine and stools,
unlike the aforementioned yellow water and blackwater. Gray water,
unlike blackwater, can be suitable for some amount of reuse, like
watering your backyard.
