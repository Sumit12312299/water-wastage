Causes of Wastewater

    <h1>
        Urban Sources of Wastewater
    </h1>
    <p>
        Wastewater is generated nearly everywhere. These include home dwellings, hotels, restaurants, cafes, motels, bars, resorts, schools, colleges, universities, places of worship, stadiums, theatres, hospitals, clinics, apartments, and all alike.

    <p>
        When they use this water it becomes contaminated with various substances which may include chemicals, bacteria, fungal colonies, metallic impurities, and organic matter which severely reduces the purity of water making it toxic and unusable; technically converting it into wastewater.
    </p>
    <h1>
        Natural Sources of Wastewater
    </h1>
    <p>
        Water can also be contaminated by other natural events such as flooding, runoff of water from gutters and cracks, water from pools, car garages, and cleaning centers. These sources also aid in the contribution of wastewater.
    </p>
    <h1>
        Agricultural Sources of Wastewater
    </h1>

    <p>
        Wastewater is also produced from agricultural lands. Agriculture requires a constant amount of freshwater for the irrigation of the crop fields so that they can be healthy and have a good yield. Unfortunately, once that water is used in agriculture, it also becomes wastewater. This is because various synthetic chemicals such as fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, and growth hormones are used in agriculture.
    </p>
    <p>
        These may pollute the water and then that wastewater may runoff into other various water bodies such as rivers, lakes, streams, seas, and oceans causing more wastewater sources to be formed. The agricultural run-off may also cause nutrient pollution leading to Cultural Eutrophication.
